## Overview
The Street Work'App is designed to connect street workout enthusiasts by recommending parks for workouts and facilitating real-life social interactions. Street workout is a growing physical activity that combines calisthenics and gymnastics, performed in outdoor spaces like parks. This app helps users find like-minded individuals to practice with and promotes the development of a local street workout community.

## Core Features
1. **Park Discovery via Location:**
    - Users can discover nearby parks for street workouts based on their current location.

2. **Friendship Through In-Person Connections:**
    - Friends can only be added by meeting at the same park and scanning a QR code, encouraging real-world connections.

3. **Park Events:**
    - Users can create and join events at parks to meet others and explore new workout locations.

4. **Account Recommendations:**
    - The app suggests users who frequent the same or nearby parks, helping to create workout communities. Users are also encouraged to schedule joint sessions.

## Secondary Features
- **Gamification:**
    - Users can earn levels, badges, and stats, rewarding consistent park visits and social connections.

- **Park Ratings and Reviews:**
    - Users can review parks based on criteria like practicality, friendliness, and aesthetics, helping others discover the best spots.

## Advanced Feature (Future Upgrade)
- **Body Pose Tracking:**
    - The app could integrate body pose tracking to help users analyze their performance on street workout figures like handstands or front levers.

## Technical Requirements
- **Firebase Integration:**
    - Parks and profiles are stored using Google Firebase.

- **Location Services:**
    - The app uses GPS for park recommendations via the Google Maps API.

- **Offline Mode:**
    - Users can view cached maps and workout plans even without an internet connection.

The Street Work'App aims to not only provide workout locations but also to build lasting connections between street workout enthusiasts in their communities.
